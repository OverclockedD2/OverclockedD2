## Programming Languages
I have used C++ for competitive programming for years and have mastered a big part of the language. I can write very fast and little memory consuming code.

The language I started my programming career with is C#, I have used C# to create various desktop and console applications.

I have spent a good amount of time learning Python and I have used it for multiple past projects.
